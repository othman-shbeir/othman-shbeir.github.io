I am Othman Shbeir, a Computer Science Valedictorian and Teaching Assistant at the Islamic University of Gaza. My work focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Computer Vision, with a strong passion for developing intelligent systems that make a real impact.

I am particularly interested in hybrid recommendation systems, generative AI (especially Large Language Models), and applied machine learning across education, media, and healthcare. My graduation thesis, HarmOni, explored AI-driven multimedia synchronization and recommendation, combining collaborative filtering, content-based models, and LLMs for enhanced personalization.

Alongside my academic journey, I gained industry experience as an AI Engineer Intern at AURA for Integrated Solutions, where I contributed to large-scale computer vision projects using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and YOLO. I have also received recognition in international hackathons and competitions, including 6th place at a Udacity Hackathon and 1st place at the Climate Thinkathon with team ReUseIt.

I am driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the belief that human-centered AI can help shape a better future.
